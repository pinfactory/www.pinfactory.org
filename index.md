Developers would prefer to release software at a
high quality level. Users prefer to use software at a
high quality level. However, firms are incentivized
to release software at a lower quality level than
would be chosen by either developers or users.

Pinfactory is a system, based on a futures market,
that lets users quantify and hedge the risks of
low-quality software, while compensating developers
to do the extra work to bring the software up to a
higher quality level.

The main idea is to introduce price
signals into the peer production of software. This
is achieved through a trading market for futures
contracts on the status of software issues. Users,
who value secure software, gain the possibility to
predict outcomes and incentivize work, strengthening
collaboration and information sharing in open
source software development.
