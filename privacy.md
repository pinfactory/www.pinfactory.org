Pinfactory websites (collectively Pinfactory
in this document) refer to sites hosted on the
pinfactory.org domain, including www.pinfactory.org and
market.pinfactory.org.  This privacy policy describes
how Pinfactory uses and protects any information that
you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your
privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal
information, you can be assured that it will only
be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Pinfactory collects
non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time
of each visitor request. Pinfactory’s purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information
is to better understand how Pinfactory’s visitors
use its website. From time to time, Pinfactory may
release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
the usage of its website.

Pinfactory also collects potentially
personally-identifying information like Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. Pinfactory does not use
IP addresses to identify its visitors, however,
and does not disclose such information, other
than under the same circumstances that it uses and
discloses personally-identifying information, as
described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Pinfactory choose to interact with
Pinfactory in ways that require Pinfactory to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and
type of information that Pinfactory gathers depends
on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
ask people who sign in to our market to provide a
username and profile URL.

In each case, Pinfactory collects such information
only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction
with Pinfactory. Pinfactory does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as
described below. And visitors can always refuse to
supply personally-identifying information, with the
caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
certain website-related activities.

All of the information that is collected on Pinfactory will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Pinfactory discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to those of project administrators,
employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations
that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Pinfactory’s behalf or to provide
services available through Pinfactory, and (ii)
that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
of those employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations may be located outside of your home
country; by using Pinfactory, you consent to the
transfer of such information to them.

Pinfactory will not rent or sell potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information to anyone. Other than to project
administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Pinfactory
discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only when required
to do so by law, if you give permission to have your
information shared, or when Pinfactory believes in
good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
to protect the property or rights of Pinfactory,
third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a Pinfactory website
and have supplied your email address, Pinfactory may
occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up
to date with what’s going on with Pinfactory.

If you send us a request (for example via a support
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
we reserve the right to publish it in order to
help us clarify or respond to your request or to
help us support other users. Pinfactory takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against
the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
destruction of potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information.

## Use of personal information

We use the information you provide to register for an account, attend our events, receive newsletters, use certain other services, or participate in the Pinfactory open source project in any other way.

We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.

We would like to send you email communication which may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have consented to receive email from Pinfactory, you may opt out later.
