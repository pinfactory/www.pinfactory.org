				<p>Pinfactory websites (collectively Pinfactory in this document) refer
to sites hosted on the pinfactory.org domain, including
www.pinfactory.org and market.pinfactory.org. This privacy policy
describes how Pinfactory uses and protects any information that you give
us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you
provide us with personal information, you can be assured that it will
only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>
<section id="website-visitors" class="level2">
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Pinfactory collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. Pinfactory’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how Pinfactory’s visitors use its
website. From time to time, Pinfactory may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Pinfactory also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Pinfactory does not
use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not
disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that
it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described
below.</p>
</section>
<section id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information"
class="level2">
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Pinfactory choose to interact with Pinfactory in
ways that require Pinfactory to gather personally-identifying
information. The amount and type of information that Pinfactory gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask people who
sign in to our market to provide a username and profile URL.</p>
<p>In each case, Pinfactory collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
interaction with Pinfactory. Pinfactory does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.</p>
<p>All of the information that is collected on Pinfactory will be
handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.</p>
</section>
<section id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information"
class="level2">
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Pinfactory discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of project
administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations
that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
Pinfactory’s behalf or to provide services available through Pinfactory,
and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using Pinfactory, you consent to the
transfer of such information to them.</p>
<p>Pinfactory will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to project
administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
described above, Pinfactory discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by
law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when
Pinfactory believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to protect the property or rights of Pinfactory, third
parties, or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of a Pinfactory website and have
supplied your email address, Pinfactory may occasionally send you an
email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
keep you up to date with what’s going on with Pinfactory.</p>
<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
other users. Pinfactory takes all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction
of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information.</p>
